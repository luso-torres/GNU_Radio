# Python and GNU Radio Interface

This repository is dedicated to introduce what is GNU Radio and how it can help to create RF (Radio Frequency) projects and any SDR (Software Developed Radio) which are both important topics in Telecommunications/Electrical Engineering.

The content is divided in:

## 1 - Basics
Basic concepts of the program such as visualizing plots, converting py documents in grc etc.
## 2 - Introduction to AM (Amplitude Modulation)
This Topic is dedicated for explaining the basic modules of the Modulator and the Demodulation
## 3 - Applications on AM modulation
Here, two codes were developed to show instances of
### DSB-SC
In this modulation, the carrier is not presented on the transmitted signal.
### DSB-FC
For this case, the modulation is used for sincronization of the signal. A envelope detector is usually applied to demodulate the signal.
## 4 - Demodulation of AM signals

## 5 - Gibbs Effect
## 6 - Applications on PM/FM modulation 
### Direct method
### Indirect method)
## 7 - Demodulation such as demodulators, discriminators, envelope detectors and more
