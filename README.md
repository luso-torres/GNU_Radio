# Welcome to the GNU_Radio Repository

This repository is dedicated to introduce what is GNU Radio and how it can help to create RF (Radio Frequency) projects and any SDR (Software Developed Radio) which are both important topics in Telecommunications/Electrical Engineering.

The content is divided in:

* 1 - Basic concepts of the program
* 2 - Introduction to AM (Amplitude Modulation)
* 3 - Applications on AM modulation (DSB-SC and DSB-FC)
* 4 - What is the Gibbs Effect and its effect on bandwidth.
* 5 - Applications on PM/FM modulation (direct and indirect methods)
* 6 - Intermediate modules such as demodulators, discriminators, envelope detectors and more
